# decorative-otp

Produces decorative one-time-pad images suitable for your next LARP, ARG or just to leave around the house.

The images produced by the script:

* Are sized to fit on a standard index card when printed
* Incorporate faux typewriter effect by randomly jittering old timey Courier-esque letters
* Are probably not suitable for actual cryptographic use
